            This project dived into OpenGL rendering and shaders. This project
            was for university and the aim was to create a scene which
            displayed a planet surface and then implement various effects. I
            decided to create planets.
        </p>
        <p class="project-text">
            To create the planets, I created a perlin noise generator in Python
            to create a cubemap. The noise doesnt quite line up but using some
            maths the cubemap can be turned into a planet.
        </p>
        <p class="project-text">
            I create a few post processing effects, including bloom, a black
            and white filter, a two different variations of blurs. These were
            all created in the shaders used, and the system I made allowed
            these to be layered over each other. The blur effects work quite
            well with the black and white effect as the blurs remove noise
            artefacts.
        </p>
        <p class="project-text">
            We also had to implement basic lighting, which involved the Phong
            lighting model. I also created a camera track system which allowed
            for the smooth animation of the cameras position and rotatation
            along all 3 axes.
