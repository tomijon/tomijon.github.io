            BlitzBox was a team project made for University. We spent 9 weeks
            working together on different areas of the game. I was responsible
            for the networking and some gameplay areas, such as the damage,
            score and health systems.

        <p class="project-text">
            I worked hard on getting the network to run smoothly and on a
            separate thread. I used the ENet library to make my own server and
            packet system. I then made a threadsafe object that was
            used to track the state of networked objects. 
        </p>
        <p class="project-text">
            In order to make movement as smooth as possible, the states were
            interpolated between based on the network tick rate. I also
            created a buffer which would store packets and process them with
            a delay of around 100ms (from when they were sent). This meant that
            it was much less likely that packets would be dropped.
        </p>
        <p class="project-text">
            I worked closely with my team to integrate what they had been
            working on with the network so that everything would work smoothly.
            I also worked on the damage and health system, which included
            healing, spawn invulnerability, and different damage types.
        </p>
        <p class="project-text">
            I really enjoyed working on this project and working with my fellow
            teammates. I think we worked incredibly well together and we are
            all very happy with how the game turned out.
