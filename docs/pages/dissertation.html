            My dissertation project studied the performance difference of procedurally generating terrain on the CPU vs on the GPU.
            It involved researching different noise generation techniques, researching mesh rendering algorithms and finally creating and testing
            the algorithms. Perlin noise and Value noise were the two noise generators used. Marching cubes was implemented to draw the
            terrain. All algorithms were written for both the CPU and GPU, using C++ for the CPU side, and GLSL for the GPU side.
