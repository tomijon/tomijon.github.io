            This project was for univeristy coursework. The aim was to create
            a genetic algorithm that could match an input image up to 95%. The
            catch was that we could only use up to 100 polygons.
        </p>
        <p class="project-text">
            We were provided with a small template that handled image
            evaluation and drawing polygons to an image. We were tasked with
            implementing the selection, crossover and mutation functions. We
            were supposed to use the genetic algorithm python module deap
            which provides functions to use. However, my own implementation ran
            faster.

            The trick to getting the algorithm to perform efficiently was to 
            figure out when it would be a good time to add a new polygon. It
            was much better to start with 1-3 polygons and then add more as the
            program slowed down. I opted to adding a new polygon after the 
            percentage increase of the solution each generation became somewhat
            stable. I took this approach so that the new polygons could add
            detail to the image, without changing the basic shape, similar to
            adding layers in painting.

            I have since started rewriting this project using C++ and OpenGL,
            working on a highly optimised version. You can find the repository
