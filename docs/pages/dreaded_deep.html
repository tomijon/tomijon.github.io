            Dreaded Deep was made for a 2 week game jam. You roam around a dark
            cave collecting artefacts while a hungry shark hunts you. With
            harpoons and a limited oxygen supply, can you collect all 6
            artefacts to win?

            A lot of credit goes to my friend Alex, who made almost the entire
            game. I unfortunately could not spend as much time as I would have
            liked on the game due to at home projects. However, I had a great
            time working on the sound design and implementation for the game.

            As my first time using unreal, I focussed a lot on trying to
            understand how it works, especially in relation to the inspector.
            In the end, I was quite happy with how the sound system worked out,
            as I managed to make a system that could easily play layered sounds
            with distance fading, all from the inspector.
