                My name is Thomas Johnson. With over 11 years programming, it's safe to say it is my passion.
                I enjoy a challenge, and love to apply my creative thinking to solve problems in a smart and
                efficient way. I've used multiple languages, with my strongest being C++, C and Python. With my vast knowledge
                of algorithms, data structures and design patterns, there's almost nothing I cannot solve. Feel
                free to checkout out the various projects I have worked on below.

                    This was a team project made by 8 of us at Newcastle
                    University. It took us 9 weeks to make. I was
                    responsible for the networking, and a few other areas

                    This project researched the performance impact of
                    procedural terrain generation on the CPU vs on the GPU.
                    It was the first program in which I used C++, OpenGL
                    and compute shaders. It implemented the marching cubes
                    algorithm to draw the terrain, and generated noise using
                    perlin noise and value noise functions. A custom weight
                    function was made to smooth the noise.
