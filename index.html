                        This project researched the performance impact of
                        procedural terrain generation on the CPU vs on the GPU.
                        It was the first program in which I used C++, OpenGL
                        and compute shaders. It implemented the marching cubes
                        algorithm to draw the terrain, and generated noise using
                        perlin noise and value noise functions. A custom weight
                        function was made to smooth the noise.

                        researching, writing the project and a final write up.
